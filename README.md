- 👋 Hi, I’m @vicplasma
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use the Nextion with the Arduino.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- How to read buttons and values from Nextion to the Arduino and how to send values to Nextion from the Arduino.
- I have found examples that work for all functions but clashs when all are put into one sketch due to mixing librarys and sometime not using libraries.
Many example appeared to work like test NexionNumberBox, but would not work with larger numbers over 32767 as I recall.

This seems to be a bug in NexNumber but I don't know enough yet to fix, it should take uint32_t but is far from it.

If anyone has an example of sending floats and button status to nextion from arduino, and sending large numbers from arduino to Nextion please assist.
